Long-Life Prayer Presented to the Incarnation of Shukseb Jetsünma
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
rigdzin drubpa daki jemo ni
Accomplished vidyādharā and foremost among the ḍākinīs,
kuntuzangmö ying lé trulpa yi
Manifesting out of the space of Samantabhadrī
chimé dechen yeshe tsogyal gyi
As the magical emanation of queen of yoginīs,
dögar drubpé wangmo denyi kyi
The display of Yeshe Tsogyal, deathless lady of great bliss,
namtrul sherab lhamö zuk gyurwa
Transformed into this goddess of wisdom—
jetsün shyönnü ku tso yündu ten
May the life of this youthful Jetsünma long remain secure.
sen sam gompé tsal chen dzokpa dang
May she realize her great potential for study, contemplation and meditation,
ten dror menpé trinlé gyé gyur chik
And may her activity to benefit the teachings and beings spread far and wide!

I, the tulku of Jamyang Khyentse, offered these words of aspiration for longevity in connection
with the offering of a name and together with 'extracting-the-essence' longevity pills,
increasing-intelligence pills, a protective necklace with a mantra knot, and a silk scarf,
on the second day of the fourth month of the Fire Bird year.1
